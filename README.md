# EncryptedUserDefaults

Store Important Personal Details of a user in a protected file on disk with EncryptedUserDefaults.
You will need to use RNCryptor Library to make it working. I have included the same in the project. 

To include it into your project:
Copy all the files residing in the Folder named "Required Files" into your working project directory.
